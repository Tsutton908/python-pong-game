# Pong Game

A short game made with Python3 Turtle library to simulate the classic arcade game Pong.

Much like the original this game is a co-op 2 player game in which each player control's one paddle. The left paddle is controled with the "w" and "s" keys, and the right paddle is controled with the "up" and "down" arrow keys. As players manage to correctly block the ball from going out bounds, the ball with progressvly get faster.

This rendetion of Pong is non-stop in such that the scores are kept, but the game will not stop at any particular scoring.
